My name is Tian, and I am a Machine Learning hobbyist. I took two ML related courses in my last year at U of T, and have since been working on ML-related projects since.

I will be writing about my projects and dumb bugs that left me confused. You can find an explanatory article on one of my projects on my friend's [site](https://www.michaelburge.us/2019/05/21/marai-agent.html).
